#### Data protection and security.

At Sapick, we implement robust security measures to protect your personal and financial information. We use encryption protocols, secure servers, and access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse of your data. Although we strive to protect your information, please be aware that no method of online transmission or storage is completely secure. We recommend users take additional precautions, such as using strong passwords and enabling two-factor authentication.

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. However, Sapick may share your data with trusted partners who assist us in providing our services (e.g., payment processors, cloud service providers). These third parties are contractually obligated to protect your information and use it only for the specified purposes. In compliance with legal obligations, we may also disclose your information to authorities if required by law or in the event of a legal dispute.
